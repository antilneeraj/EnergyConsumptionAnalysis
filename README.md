## Introduction

The World Energy Consumption Analysis project is a data-driven initiative aimed at understanding and predicting energy consumption patterns for individual countries and the world at large. Leveraging historical data and employing traditional linear regression algorithms, the project provides valuable insights into energy mix trends, per capita consumption, renewable energy growth, carbon intensity, and more.

---

## Highlights

- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes a traditional linear regression algorithm to forecast future energy consumption.
- **Country-Specific Analysis:** Provides a detailed breakdown of energy trends for a user-selected country.
- **Global Perspective:** Extends the analysis to predict world energy consumption trends.
- **Visualizations:** Presents findings through interactive and informative visualizations.

---

## Objectives

1. **In-Depth Analysis:** Conduct a detailed analysis of energy consumption trends for specific countries.
2. **Prediction Modeling:** Develop a predictive model to forecast future energy consumption.
3. **Global Insights:** Extend the analysis to provide insights into worldwide energy consumption patterns.

---

## Methodology

The project employs a comprehensive methodology involving data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and traditional linear regression modeling. By leveraging Python and key libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, the project ensures accurate analysis and predictions.

---

## Software and Libraries Used

1. **Python & Visual Studio Code:** Primary development platform and code editor.
2. **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
3. **Matplotlib:** Data visualization.
4. **Scikit-Learn:** Implementation of the machine learning algorithm.
5. **Numpy:** Numerical computing support.

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script and follow the prompts to select a country for analysis.

---

## Results

The project provides detailed visualizations showcasing energy mix trends, per capita consumption, renewable energy growth, carbon intensity, and more. The predictive model's performance is evaluated with root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics.

---

## Future Work

Future enhancements to the project may include:
- Integration of additional machine learning algorithms.
- Expansion of the dataset for more comprehensive analyses.
